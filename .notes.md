- schema will have attribute `crate=false` by default (crates will not be generated)
- every service will use abstract `ICrate` instead of crate implementations (with eventual schema check)
- `IIdentity` will be managed by proprietary Authenticator, so `IIdentityManager` don't need to be clever (have storage)
	- for example `DatabaseAuthenticator` will also have methods for new user registration
- marker interfaces for schemas (so schema definition will be kind of interface implementation)
	- same for crates
- schema configuration will have crate name in meta and eventually storable name in meta; thus if they will be missing,
no crates/storables will be generated (maybe storable will be only bool flag like now)

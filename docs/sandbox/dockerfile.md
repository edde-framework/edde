# Dockerfile

Basic idea is to build fresh image on [Alpine Linux](https://alpinelinux.org/about/) to keep things small; there are plenty of images
which are quite complex; custom image is a bit better as you have everything under control and it's not hard to maintain this kind of image.

To prevent [zombie processes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zombie_process) in the image, we have to run proper [init system](http://smarden.org/runit/).

> `.docker` folder will hide all Docker related stuff to keep things clear.

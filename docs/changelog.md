# Changelog

!> Changelog will not display a little changes on API level (you can use `git` for that); main
purpose is to describe changes between generations of Edde and bigger conceptual changes.

## Production Generation

### 5.0 (~2018)

Fresh restart with a lot of refactored stuff, mature Container, polished concepts and a version
in general available for public release. Also the very first version with full documentation.

Full support of Docker with [documentation](/getting-started/index) of a production usage.

Finally a version which could be considered polished enough for bigger spread.

> Welcome to the new age. Basically everything has been validated to be as much usable, as possible.
Cool bugs, cool features, everything you could find inside. But with a strong and mature framework.

## Historical iterations

### 4.0 - 4.5 (~2015-2017)

Generation of Edde which is basically starting to be mature enough for production use, still with
a lot of things which are suboptimal - mainly quite clever ORM, but with some flaws

First version with a specialization of pure backend development - this simplified a lot
of things in the framework and also brings default support for Docker so it's much more simple to
develop Edde itself or using Edde as a framework.

Main flaw of this generation was ORM itself as other components was not iterated too much.

> So this is really serious work, but still it needs some time to go over some internal craps which
has been there from the beginning, it has to be polished. Edde is alone on the field with a few others.

### 3.0 (~2014)

This generation brings custom template engine and server side rendering support. A lot of interesting
stuff, but based on the wrong concepts. 

Some components are done in quite good way, but also there was some complications rendering framework
usable, but quite heavy.

Based on experience gained from this iteration an ongoing version was starting to have finally shape
of the production framework. 

As usual, there was some bugs, but Edde was stable enough to stand for some quite heavy projects, even
`component` related stuff complicated some parts of development.

> Even toughest of programmers being able to went this far could be drained enough to throw their work
away as you can see a lot of dead "the world's best framework, blah blah" on GitHub. For Edde this is
just beginning.

### 2.0 (~2013)

A lot of improved stuff from the original library; not so much changes (as far as I remember). This was
kind of second generation of Edde, but also the very first iteration as a standalone framework with
all the features framework must have.

Still not mature enough - a lot of work is behind to take and a lot of components need it's iteration
to be production grade. 

> When you are determined enough to keep going, you could end up basically somewhere around here. You have
some cool experience, some piece of interesting software, but no further way.  

### 1.0 (~2011)

The original release as library under [Nette Framework](https://nette.org/) with high specialization
on ORM level and way how to generate PHP classes and database structure from simple format
([neon](https://ne-on.org/)).

Very first iteration before the library started it's path to overgrow it's parent.

> Version could be considered as a kind of childish play as a lot of people starts and ends with this
kind of "framework".

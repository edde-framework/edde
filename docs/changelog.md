# Changelog

!> Changelog will not display a little changes on API level (you can use `git` for that); main
purpose is to describe changes between generations of Edde and bigger conceptual changes.

## 5.0 (~2018)

Fresh restart with a lot of refactored stuff, mature Container, polished concepts and a version
in general available for public release. Also the very first version with full documentation.

Full support of Docker with [documentation](/getting-started/index) of a production usage.

## 4.0 - 4.5 (~2017)

Generation of Edde which is basically starting to be mature enough for production use, still with
a lot of things which are suboptimal - mainly quite clever ORM, but with some flaws. Last
private version available in a separate branch.

First version with a specialization of pure backend development - this decision simplified a lot
of things in the framework.

Initial support for Docker.

## 3.0 (~2016)

Edde become standalone framework with initial implementation of whole bunch of things - Container,
Controls (server side rendering), template engine, simple ORM.

## 2.0 (~2013)

A lot of improved stuff from the original library; not so much changes (as far as I remember).

## 1.0 (~2011)

The original release as library under [Nette Framework](https://nette.org/) with high specialization
on ORM level and way how to generate PHP classes and database structure from simple format
([neon](https://ne-on.org/)).

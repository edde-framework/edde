Let's say it at very first: this piece of PHP code is much more different from the stuff generally available in PHP world mainly
because of love and precise craftsmanship put into building the codebase.

A lot of things has many iterations behind, the code itself is not much more like "just another framework" as it stands for
ideas which it could simply argue about.  

So that's the core: [Concepts and Ideas](/ideas). A lot of things are done in different way or are generally "incompatible" with current
state of PHP scene, but I believe in my work and in the effort put in to make the things work :wink: !. 

# Important Notes

!> **Huge note at the beginning** I think SemVer has some major flaws, mainly related to hiding how big a change in code base is (for example 1.2 with
small api breaking change should be 2.0 same as completely rewritten library); thus I do **not** follow SemVer much more like **BrainVer**. Major
version is generation jump (a lot of work to move to a new version) and minor versions marking API breaks.

!> **Backward compatibility** and maintenance does not exists in this project: versions are archived in branches and they're available. If you find
some critical bug or you want some feature, it will not be solved in older versions than the current generation.

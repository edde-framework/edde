# Environment

?> All examples here are build around Docker, Docker Composer and [Docker Swarm](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/). Even
there are much more cool orchestrators like [Kubernets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/) or [OpenShift](https://www.openshift.com/),
if you are not heavily experienced in [DevOps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps), Swarm is for humans, natively supports
`docker-compose.yml` and it simple to setup at all (what about `docker swarm init` ?). Thus this tutorial follows production
environment build on Docker Swarm.

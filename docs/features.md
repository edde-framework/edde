# Features

> Edde is simple and powerful framework able to deliver convenient experience on backend development without messing with
unnecessary features. 

## Prolog

Why to use another PHP framework, instead of another one with huge community, a lot of QA on Stack Overflow and
other benefits missing on this project?

Maybe that's the benefit: because of kind of one-man-show project has much more straightforward approach, it's
more consistent and much simpler. Everything is publicly available, including this doc as a part of the
[repository](https://github.com/edde-framework/edde/tree/master/docs). At least framework will stay alive.

See [Story](/story) how long Edde is here, it's quite long reading because for now it's few years.

## Concepts

Edde is not another implementation of existing parts of another libraries or frameworks; it has it's own ideas,
it's own concepts. And because of concepts whole framework is simple and clear; a lot of wrong decisions was
already made (for example no package splitting or no [ORM](/edde/orm) implementation). Also formally code
has quite high grade based on different tools with code insight.
